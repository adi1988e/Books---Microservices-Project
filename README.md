<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project
This Project Uses Docker and Kubernetes to deploy a multi-service app to Digital Ocean provider. <br />
In this application, users can buy or sell books if they have registered and connected to the site.  <br />
The authentication on the site uses a JWT token, and the payment is via Stripe.

### Built With

* On the frontend, i used <strong> React </strong> and <strong> Next JS </strong> to present content to users.  <br />
* Each service is created using <strong>  Node </strong> and <strong>  Express </strong>.  <br />
* Data for each service is held in either a <strong>  Mongo database </strong> or <strong>  Redis </strong>.  <br />
* The entire app is deployed and runs in <strong>  Docker </strong> containers executed in a <strong>  Kubernetes </strong> cluster.   <br />
* Almost all of the code in this fullstack application written with <strong>  Typescript </strong>.
